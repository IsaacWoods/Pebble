**Pebble is still very early in development**

Pebble is an operating system written in Rust, with a focus on safety and simplicity. It is designed to be simple to understand, extend, and develop for. Pebble does not aim for POSIX compliance.

The best way to learn about Pebble is to read [the book](https://pebble-os.github.io/book).
